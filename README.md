# face-detection-and-recognition
Machine Learning project based on Computer Vision
As we know that there is an abnormal increase in crime rate, with the increase in number of criminals as well which raises a great concern about security issues. 
Crime prevention and criminal identification are the primary issues before the police personnel. 
With the ongoing advancement in security technology, cameras especially CCTV has been installed in public and private areas for surveillance activities. 
The footage from CCTV can be used to identify suspects on scene using Face Recognition Technology
. 
The objective of this project is to help the law enforcement agencies to identify and track criminal(s) in real time. 
This system will be able to detect and recognize face(s) of criminal(s) from the criminal records database of law enforcement automatically and providing attributes such as date, time and location of sighting of said criminal. 
Moreover, this project can also help in locating missing person(s) in police records.
